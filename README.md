# mage-ad-guide
A guide on how to set up Mage.ai to use ActiveDirectory authentication with PyODBC.

The guide is not completely agnostic and you may need to tailor some aspects to your  
or your company's specific requirements.

I am not an expert on neither Kerberos, nor ActiveDirectory, this guide just details  
the steps I took based on research and some internal help that worked for me.

I decided to share this guide here as I could not find anything on it during my  
research and it would have saved me a week's worth of work. 

Hopefully, it will help you.
